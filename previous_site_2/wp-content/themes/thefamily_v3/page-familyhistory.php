								<p><strong>1996.  Chris Zander meets a teenaged Anna Rotholz at Yoga Zone in Irvington, NY.</strong>  Anna was the receptionist at Yoga Zone, and Chris was training. Chris sometimes brought his kids to Yoga Zone. One of them bit Anna. Anna instantly became indoctrinated into the Zander Family.</p>
								
								<p><strong>1999.  Diane Patrone and Chris Zander meet at Schofield Films. </strong>Diane was head of production at Schofield Films. Chris Zander had his own successful independent repping company, Zander Reps Inc. Diane was in charge of finding a new rep for Schofield. She called Chris. Although she did not hire Chris, they struck up a friendship.</p>
								
								<p><strong>2001. Chris hires Diane’s friend. All become buddies. </strong>Diane was working as a rep at Headquarters Films.  Chris mentioned he was looking for a rep to join him at ZRI.  Chris hired one of Diane’s best friends (LB) for the job. Over the next few years, CZ, LB, and DP became best buds. Attended many industry functions together. DP and CZ talked shop. A lot.</p>
								
								<p><strong>December 2004.  Anna works for Chris at ZRI.  </strong>Anna was a senior in college, and was looking for a part time job.  Chris hired her to be the receptionist at ZRI. Diane was head of sales at Crew Cuts.  Diane and Chris met often to discuss business, and she and Anna became friends. Chris constantly hinted to Diane to start her own repping company. Diane did not listen (typical). Anna transitioned into working for ZRI full time after her graduation in 2005.</p>
								
								<p><strong>April 2004. The Fateful Lunch.  </strong>Chris convinced Diane to go to Cannes and attend the annual Lions Awards Festival, advertising’s biggest awards show. Diane convinced Crew Cuts to pay for her trip.</p> 
								
								<p><strong>June 2004. The French Riviera. </strong>Chris hooked Diane up with a room in the famous Backyard villa (BYP is one of his clients), and a ticket to the even more famous Backyard Pool Party.  Everyone got along instantly. Within five minutes of being at the villa, Diane was almost impaled by a run-away picnic umbrella. Calamity would become a running theme. Amongst late night parties and Gutter Bar injuries, Chris and Diane realized they were more then just pals. They were like-minded business people who together formed a powerful networking and marketing machine! Talk began of working together.</p>
								
								<p><strong>August 2004. Chris and Diane partner to launch The Family.</strong> While pondering names, they almost decided to call their company Sabbatical.  Diane said to Chris, “I want something that says who we are, and what we are about all at once.” Chris said, “Yeah, we’re more than reps and business partners, we’re great friends.” Diane said “You’ve repped Backyard since day one, and I have grown to love those guys…we’re all practically family.”  And so it was. <strong>THE FAMILY WAS BORN.</strong>

							<div>
								<p>Most people don’t have the option to choose their own family. At birth, you’re pretty much stuck with your mom, your dad, your crazy aunts and uncles, your grandparents and maybe (if you luck out) an awesome sibling or two. Sure, someday you’ll probably get to choose your spouse. But don’t forget that he or she comes with his or her own set of family members too (commonly known as In-Laws…the brunt of many a comedian’s jokes).</p>
								<p>Families aren’t all that bad. They’re wonderful support systems and will always love us in good times and bad. But you’d be lying if you didn’t admit to thinking, “I wonder what it’d be like if I could choose my brother (or sister) instead of being related to the (insert adjective) one I was dealt.” Such is the plight of virtually all families.  But not ours.  Ours is a different kind of Family with a very special and unique history.</p>
								<p>Let’s begin back in 1999. Diane Patrone was head of production at a busy, one director shop, Schofield Films, and Chris Zander had his own successful independent repping company, Zander Reps. One day, as luck (or fate?) would have it, Diane’s company needed a rep, and she called in Chris. The two hit it off immediately, but ultimately did not end up working together.  Two years later, Diane had transitioned out of production and into sales, and was working as a senior rep for Headquarters Films.  Chris was in search of a junior rep to join his company.  Diane recommended her close friend (LB!) for the job. Chris hired LB as his new rep, beginning her extremely successful career in this business.</p>
								<p>As the years went on, Chris and Diane’s friendship grew, and they became sounding boards for each other. Then, one fine spring day in 2004, the two had lunch at Avra, their favorite Midtown restaurant to meet at after screenings.  Chris convinced Diane that she must make the annual ad pilgrimage to Cannes that year. He offered her a room at the famous Backyard Villa and a guaranteed invite to their Thursday afternoon Pool Party. Who could say no to that?! In a testament to her ability to sell anyone on anything, Diane sold the idea of sending her on an all expenses paid trip to the French Riviera through to her employer (Crew Cuts, a company that had never had a sales rep, let alone sent one to Cannes!). The two were off to the beautiful south of France.</p>
								<p>After a week of networking on the Cote d’Azur, Chris and Diane realized that they were more then friends … they were business partners too. Their approach to their work was totally in sync. Both had qualities and strengths that complimented each other’s, and they knew they could be a powerful team. </p> 
								<p>In the summer of August 2004, Chris and Diane started a new company. The marketplace didn’t need another indie repping firm, so their goal was to create a different kind of company, one that focused on building careers and growing brands. They were determined to create a place where growth, nurturing and support were at the core of every relationship they created. They were committed to becoming problem solvers, strategic thinkers and relationship builders for everyone they worked with. They also decided that they’d only do business with people they liked and people they could build long-term relationships with.  So, they aptly named their company The Family, and instead of calling themselves "co-founders" or "partners," they chose to call themselves Brother and Sister. The company name and their “titles” truly embodied their relationship, the philosophy of their company and how they wanted the companies they chose to represent to feel…like Family.</p>
								<p>The next six years were fun, exciting, and successful for The Family and it’s Family members.</p>
								<p>Then, in early 2010, the immediate Family grew with the addition of Anna Rotholz. Anna’s history with The Family goes way back.  Actually, it even pre-dates The Family.</p>
								<p>Anna grew up NY’s Westchester County near where Chris and his family reside.  In 1996, Anna was an industrious and hard working teen. She was the part time receptionist at the yoga studio where Chris practiced. Chris occasionally brought his kids to the studio and asked Anna to watch them while he Namaste’d.  It was during one of these yoga/babysitting situations that Chris’ son Ben bit Anna on the arm.  Instead of suing the Zanders, she immediately became part of the Zander family forever.</p>
								
								<p>Cut to 2004 and the start of Anna’s senior year of college at Hunter in NYC. Chris hired her as the part time receptionist for his company. When Diane and Chris started The Family later that year, Anna worked as their assistant, earning the title of The Family's first ever Little Sister. A year after graduation, Anna struck out on her own to work at other companies, building on what she learned at The Family and fostering her own relationships. After four years and much success, Anna returned home to The Family in 2010 as Another Sister. Her return, and immense success here, embodies what The Family is all about.</p>
								
								<p>Not only have we been lucky enough to have built The Family into the company Chris and Diane envisioned back in Cannes all those years ago, but we’ve been fortunate enough to choose who we get to build it with. We’re proud of the long relationships we’ve developed, and the talent and companies we’ve helped grow along the way. And like all families, we’re constantly evolving and expanding.</p>
								
								<p>At the end of September 2011, The Family moved into a bigger home on West 21st Street, and simultaneously launched our new virtual home at <a href="http://www.thefamilynyc.com/home/">www.thefamilynyc.com</a>.</p>
